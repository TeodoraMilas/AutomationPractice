AutomationPractice is a project that I've started while learning automation testing.

I'm using https://demo-teo.herokuapp.com/ - a demo website for e-commerce - to practice my magic.

What I've used: Selenium with Java, jUnit, Maven, Jenkins

I like to keep things simple and develop them as needed.

Features:
- browsers configured using Factory pattern: Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Edge, IE
- page object pattern for separating actual tests from their methods
- take screenshots when tests fail

Currently working on:
- reporting test results
